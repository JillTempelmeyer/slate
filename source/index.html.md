# Actum Integration Guide

Actum's API allows developers to manage a variety of powerful tasks, such as creating and updating transacions, managing customer and payment data, and querying settlement information. It was initially built for merchants requiring a high level of customization. Its customizable architecture now enables simple integration with software partners, as well. Actum uses HTTPS for all transactions to ensure the safety of consumer information. 

This guide provides an overview for our merchants and partners of how to start using Actum. If you have any questions throughout the process, please don't hesitate to contact us at [support@actumprocessing.com](support@actumprocessing.com).

# Getting Started
 
To get started using Actum's API, you'll want to follow these steps:
 
### Step 1: Register for a Test Account
 
First, you will want to navigate to Actum's [Register for a Test Account](https://www.actumprocessing.com/register-test-account/) page. You will need to enter your First Name, Last Name, Email, Company Name, and Phone Number to sign up. Actum's support team will use this information for verification purposes in order to create your account.

Once your account is created (typically within less than 24 hours on business days), you will receive a welcome email with your new test account credentials. 

### Step 2: Log into your Test Account

To begin testing, you will be able to log into a test portal using the username and password provided by Actum's support team. Actum's portal is available at the following link: [https://join.actumprocessing.com](https://join.actumprocessing.com)

It is recommended that you change your password immediately upon login. There is no need to create a separate API key to complete setup, as your username and password will allow you to authenticate to Actum's test enviroment, securely.

### Step 3: Create a Call

To create a new API call, you'll first want to join the server at [https://join.actumprocessing.com/cgi-bin/dbs/man_trans.cg](https://join.actumprocessing.com/cgi-bin/dbs/man_trans.cgi). The following parameters are required:

* `username` (your assigned username)
* `password`(the password associated with your username, that can be changed)

(unsure of the following):
* `syspass` (a system password assigned your account, that cannot be changed)
* `action_code` (this uses `D`)
* `order id` (order number of a test transaction

**Note:** All API request methods are `POST` only. In this case, `POST` requests act similarly to `GET` requests, in that the requests function primarily to return information pertaining to a specific resource. 

The content type you'll need to use is `application/x---www---form---urlencoded **or** multipart/form--data`.

# Sample Responses

Sample responses come in two types: `Accepted` and `Declined`.  Each type of response is outlined below in the following sections and can be directed to the same or different scripts, based on preference.  

Responses are not URL encoded and are new-line delimited.  Below is a sample response, which contains the status of the transaction `Accepted` or `declined`, a reason for any declined status, and a set of variables returned from the transaction server, and `PostedVars`, which is a block that contains all variables passed to the Actum Processing system, except for the account information.

# Tracking a Transaction

The transaction history files contain all initial sales (Check Pre-Auth, Same-day Debit), Returns (Check Return), Funded Debits (Check Settlement), and Refunds / Credits (Check Refund, Same-day Credit) from the previous day.  A transaction history file will come in a flat, quote-qualifier, comma-delimited file, which can either be picked up from our SFTP server or sent to the merchant’s SFTP server. 

The following Operating systems are expecting the following to know when there is an end of line:

* UNIX uses a (LF) Linefeed
* Windows uses a (CRLF) Carriage Return / Line Feed
* The Transaction History File on our server will only have a (LF) Line Feed

If you transfer the file correctly using ASCII on a Windows Machine, you will get a file with (CRLF) Carriage Return / Line Feed. If transferred incorrectly, the file in BINARY will looked garbled and all data will be on the first line.

You will need to download the file in ASCII to make sure there is no data corruption.

## Transaction History File Format

### Returned Variables

The naming format of the transaction history file will be:

`PARENTID-trans-ACTUM-YYYYMMDD.txt` e.g.: `ACTUMTEST-trans-ACTUM-20050212.txt`

### Order Tracking

**Persistent Data:** Order Number, SubID
**Reference Data:** History KeyID, Reference KeyID

### Definitions

**Order:** An order is all transactions of Check Pre-Auth, Check Settlement, Check Return, Check Late Return for an order by a consumer.

**Transaction:** This is one particular piece of a transaction as in the Check Pre-Auth, etc.

**Transaction Block:** Is the block of transactions from validating the account / requesting the monies to receiving the monies or receiving a return. One order can have several transaction blocks for the initial transactions and the recurred transactions.

**To Determine Initial Transactions:**  
Take all transactions for a date range then parse them out by Check Pre-Auth where the Reference KeyID is blank and Recurring Description is Initial. This number gives you the total number of initial signups during that time period.

**Refunds:** Refunds can only be issued after a Check Settlement.

**Tracking the Stages of an Order:** Each product sold will have a persistent Order Number throughout the life span of the order, even when it is in a recurring stage. The combination of the Order Number, Reference KeyID and History KeyID will let you track the step-by-step transactions that led to the current status of an order.  

**Linking up Transactions for a Particular Order**

If you get a Check Return but you don’t know where it occurred in the order or from what transaction block, you can use referencekeyid found with the Check Return entry to start the process of finding which block it came from for this particular order. Take this reference keyid and look for a transaction that contains that referencekeyid as the historykeyid. This should return the Check Pre-Auth for which we received the Check Return. You can use this process for any Check Return, Check Late Return, Check Refund, Check Settlement, ACH NOC, etc… until you find a transaction entry that has a blank referencekeyid. This puts you at the beginning of this particular transaction block.

One thing to note is that each time we recur a transaction the Check Pre-Auth will have a blank referencekeyid indicating that a new transaction block is starting. The easiest way to see the transaction blocks in order would be to grab all transactions for a particular orderid and then sort those by date and referencekeyid, which should put those into order from start to finish. Remember, sometimes you may see a Check Settlement for the recurred billing before the initial trial price settles.

Another approach if you wanted to display each transaction block would be to grab all Check Pre-Auth sorted by date with a blank referencekeyid. Then, go through each of those using the historykeyid and find the next transaction in the list by looking for the next transaction that contains that history keyid as the referencekeyid. Grab the history keyid for that transaction and look for the transaction that contains that as the referencekeyid. You can continue this process until you get no more results indicating that you have hit the end of the transaction block and continue with the next transaction block in the list.

Our recommendation is to import everything because the data can be used to your advantage later. Order Number and SubID will always be persistent, and if you sort the transactions by date, you can get a very clear idea of what went on with the account.  In rare cases, we send two transactions per Order Number in one day, but timestamps should show the definitive order.



# Introduction

Welcome to the Kittn API! You can use our API to access Kittn API endpoints, which can get information on various cats, kittens, and breeds in our database.

We have language bindings in Shell, Ruby, Python, and JavaScript! You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

This example API documentation page was created with [Slate](https://github.com/lord/slate). Feel free to edit it and use it as a base for your own API's documentation.

# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```ruby
require 'kittn'

api = Kittn::APIClient.authorize!('meowmeowmeow')
```

```python
import kittn

api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow')
```

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here"
  -H "Authorization: meowmeowmeow"
```

```javascript
const kittn = require('kittn');

let api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow');
```

> Make sure to replace `meowmeowmeow` with your API key.

Kittn uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new Kittn API key at our [developer portal](http://example.com/developers).

Kittn expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: meowmeowmeow`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>meowmeowmeow</code> with your personal API key.
</aside>
